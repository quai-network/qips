## Abstract
This QIP defines an algorithm by which different chains within the Quai tree of
chains may agree to expand the tree and activate new chains. This algorithm
provides a deterministic decision based on hash measurements in each section of
the tree.

## Motivation
The Quai protocol achieves high transactional throughput by dividing
transactional processing into independent shards. Each shard achieves shared
total security via merged-mining. Adding more chains into the tree enables
higher throughput, at the cost of increased cross-chain settlement times.
Therefore, it is desirable for the network to activate only as few chains as
are necessary to satisfy the users' demand for transactions.

As the number of transactions processed by the network increases, block
propagation & processing time will increase (a.k.a. block acceptance time).
This increase in block acceptance time results in higher probability of
competing blocks produced within the same time, and thus short reorganizations
(a.k.a. uncleed uncles) as the networks decides on the canonical set of blocks.
The ratio of work committed to blocks that ultimately do not get accepted, can
be measured as wasted work performed by miners. By measuring this waste, we can
objectively determine the efficiency with which miners secure the network,
which we refer to as "security efficiency".

This specification provides a mechanism for measuring the security efficiency
of the network, so that when security efficiency becomes unacceptably low, the
network can agree to add more chains to increase transactional capacity (at the
expense of cross-chain settlement times) to improve security efficiency.

## Specification
### Measuring Entropy Lost To Uncle Blocks
To measure the security efficiency of the network, nodes will need to compute
the ratio of the amount of entropy which gets lost to uncle blocks vs the
amount of entropy which gets accepted by canonical blocks. To facilitate this,
each block needs to record these entropy measurements.

PoEM already describes the method of computing and recording entropy reduction
in each block. That calculation is repeated below for completeness:

$$ S_i = 256 - log(hash(block_i)) $$

Uncle entropy calculation is slightly different. Since each block may reference
multiple parallel uncles, the entropy for each should be accumulated.For N
uncles, the uncle entropy of a block shall be computed by summing the entropy
of each uncle hash:

$$ S_{i,uncles} = \sum_{j=0}^N (256 - log(hash(uncle_{i,j}))) $$

where $uncle_{i,j}$ is the $j^{th}$ uncle recorded in $block_i$.

### Computing Security Efficiency Score $f$
Each node shall record recently uncled entropy and recently accepted entropy
values for each chain it is participating in. Recentness of this measurement is
achieved by applying an exponentially weighted moving average to the
accepted/uncled entropy observed at each new block. This score can be computed
iteratively with each new block added to the chain. First, the node will
compute an exponentially weighted moving average of the uncle_entropy and
accepted_entropy. 

The weighted accepted & uncled entropies must be recorded in each chain, so
that an aggregate security score can be computed in the prime chain of any
node, regardless of which subordinate chains a node participates in.

#### Computing Cumulative Accepted & Uncled Entropies in Zone Chains
In accordance with PoEM consensus, each node already measures the cumulativ
entropy reduction achieved by the work performed on every block. This entropy
is accumulated and referred to as $S$. Additionally, in the Quai protocol,
dominant chains record the cumulative entropy reduction achieved by each
subordinate chain, referred to as $\Delta S_{sub}$. Each of these values are
recorded in the header for their parent block, as `ParentS` and
`ParentSubDeltaS`.

In order for dominant chains to compute a security score across the network,
each chain will additionally need to record the uncled entropy and cumulative
uncled entropy, $S_{uncle}$ & $\Delta S_{sub, uncles}$ respectively. These
values shall be calculated identically to the accepted entropies, except that
the computation will be measured on the uncle blocks instead of the accepted
blocks.

##### Necessary Zone Chain Data In Block Header
In addition to as $S$ & $\Delta S_{sub}$, which are already recorded in the
header, each chain shall record $S_{uncle}$ & $\Delta S_{sub, uncles}$. The
four values recorded in the header (except in the case of zones, which do not
have subordinate chains to record), are given as follows:

```
type Header {
    ...
    // The accepted entropy measurements are already a requirement from PoEM
    ParentAcceptedS[3]: bigint,         // prime/region/zone parent *accepted* entropy
    ParentAcceptedSubDeltaS[2]: bigint, // prime/region subordinate cumulative *accepted* entropy

    // This spec additionally requires uncled entropy measurements
    ParentUncledS[3]: bigint,           // prime/region/zone parent *uncled* entropy
    ParentUncledSubDeltaS[2]: bigint,   // prime/region subordinate cumulative *uncled* entropy
    ...
}
```

#### Computing a Network-Wide Security Score
Before computing a security score, we must exponentially weight the cumulative
entropies, to prevent the score from becoming overwhelmingly biased by old
blocks. We can then use these weighted measurements to compute a security
score.

##### Computing Exponentially Weighted Entropies
First compute an error value $\epsilon_i$, as the exponentially weighted uncle
entropy at block[i]:

$$ \epsilon[i] = S_{uncle}[i-1] * \alpha + S_{uncle}[i]*(1 - \alpha) $$

Next compute the exponentially weighted accepted entropy, $S_{exp}$ at block[i]:

$$ S_{exp}[i] = S[i-1] * \alpha + S[i]*(1 - \alpha) $$

> Note, for efficiency `S` values are recorded and computed in their log2 form,
> rounded to the nearest integer (aka bits).

In the above computations, $\alpha$ is a smoothing factor (also referred to as
TREE_EXPANSION_FILTER_ALPHA), which should be selected to filter our short term
perturbances in network efficiency.

##### Computing A Security Score
The following equation can be used to compute the security score, $f$:

$$ f[i] = \epsilon[i] / S_{exp}[i] $$

$f$ may be used as an _inverse_ indication of the network's security
efficiency. The protocol should seek to minimize $f$ in each zone, which it can
do by expanding the tree to create more zones. Larger $\alpha$ will increase
the total magnitude of uncled entropy required to increase $f$. This
effectively reduces the protocol's eagerness to expand the tree.

A security score can be computed in the same way for any chain, but this
protocol is only interested in the global score, denoted as $f_{global}$, to
decide when to expand the tree of chains. The global score is the $f$ score
computed on the prime chain.

### Activating New Chains
When $f_{global}$ exceeds a certain threshold for a long enough time, the
network can agree that it is time to add more chains to increase the
transactional capacity of the network. The process for deciding when and how to
add more chains, is described in the sections below.

#### When to Expand
The network will agree to add more chains to the tree, once all of the following
conditions are met:
1) all active chains have mined consecutive prime blocks confirming
$f_{global}$ exceeds the `TREE_EXPANSION_THRESHOLD`
1) `TREE_EXPANSION_TRIGGER_WINDOW` consecutive prime blocks confirm
$f_{global}$ after condition 1.

Once the expansion criteria have been met, the network will schedule expansion
to occur in the future. After `TREE_EXPANSION_WAIT_COUNT` blocks have elapsed
since the block which finalized the decision to expand, blocks from the new
chains will be accepted by the network. The last prime block of the wait period
`TREE_EXPANSION_WAIT_COUNT` will be refered to here on as the prime activation
block.

#### How Many Chains To Add
The Quai protocol defines a tree of blockchains of order 2. Initially, the tree
is of degree 1: prime chain, with a single subordinate region chain, which has
a single subordinate zone chain. As the network decides to add new chains, it
will use the following algorithm to decide how many chains to add, and in which
branches of the tree:

```
Algorithm to decide which chains to add:
1: if degree(zone) <= degree(region) then
2:   add 1 chain to each zone
3: else then
4:   add 1 region under prime
5:   add degree(zone) zones under the new region
6: end if
```

For example, the table below gives the tree ontology after the first few expansions
| Expansion no. | # regions in prime | # zones in each region |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 0 (genesis)   | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 |
| 5 | 3 | 4 |
| 6 | 4 | 4 |
| . | . | . |
| . | . | . |
| . | . | . |
| 30 | 15 | 15 |
| 31 | 15 | 16 |
| 32 | 16 | 16 |

#### Old Zones Wait To Send ETXs
To mitigate migration challenges to the new chains, its important for the
blockchains to stabilize and merge mine together for some time, before
processing cross-chain transactions. To achieve this, we add a few constraints
that must be satisfied before cross-chain transactions can be sent to these new
chains.

First, the following sequence of events must occur:
1) first, the new chain must mine a prime block that gets accepted by the
network
1) then the sending chain must mine a prime block committing to the new chain
as an ancestor.

Additionally, at least `TRANSACTION_WAIT_COUNT` prime blocks must have been
mined on-top of the new chain's first prime block.

Once these two conditions occur, the old chain may begin to process external
transactions destined to the new chain. These conditions must be satisfied for
any chain wishing to send to any of the newly added chains.

#### Genesis Block for New Chains
Once new chains have been activated, the activation block will be treated as
the genesis block for all newly activated chains. The first block after genesis
is built as an extension, with zone and optionally region parameters reset for
the new chain.

> as the first expansion from a degree-0 tree to degree-1. All expansion logic
> is identical, even in this special case.

#### Network Parameters after Expansion
When new chains are added, they will result in new resources available to the
network. Each of these chains can process TXs up to some gas limit, generate
block rewards for miners, produce blocks at a rate according to network
difficulty, etc. Since the addition of a new chain does not change the number
of miners/users/etc on the network, we initialize adjust all parameters
ratiometrically according to the new resources added.

Generally, for each resource, we allocate 1/network_total to each new chain,
and we reduce allocation proportionally to the existing chains. These new
parameters take effect after the expansion activation block. Specifically, here
are the calculations for each new parameters, for an expansion occuring at
block $N$:

##### Block Reward
For new and old chains alike:

$$BlockReward_{chain} = \frac{BlockReward_{network}}{no. of chains} $$

##### Difficulty
For new chains:

$$Difficulty_{chain} = \frac{Difficulty_{network}}{no. of chains} $$

For existing chains:

$$Difficulty_{chain}[i] = Difficulty_{chain}[i-1] * \frac{no. old chains}{no. of chains}$$

##### Gas Limit
For new chains:

$$GasLimit_{chain} = \frac{GasLimit_{network}}{no. of chains} $$

For existing chains:

$$GasLimit_{chain}[i] = GasLimit_{chain}[i-1] * \frac{no. old chains}{no. of chains}$$

#### Example

### Security Statement
This specification works as long as miners record the uncles they witness. If
miners choose not to record uncles, then the protocol cannot effectively
measure uncled entropy. Therefore the incentive structure of the network should
make sure that the dominant strategy for a miner is to record uncles, in lieu
of any incentive they may have to prevent the network from expanding. This
should not be difficult, but incentive mechanisms will be left for another QIP.

### Choosing Expansion Parameters
The above protocol for tree expansion is defined around a few adjustable
parameters, given below:

#### TREE_EXPANSION_FILTER_ALPHA
This is the smoothing factor (range 0-1) used by each zone in its low-pass
filter to gather a long running average of the zone's security efficiency
score. Choosing a larger $\alpha$ will make the filter less responsive; the
tree expansion algorithm will be less susceptible to short term variations in
the efficiency score, but will take longer to decide to trigger an expansion
when one becomes necessary.

> Choose TREE_EXPANSION_FILTER_ALPHA = 0.9

#### TREE_EXPANSION_THRESHOLD
This is the threshold (range 0-1) above which the $f_{global}$ score will begin
the tree expansion decision process. This threshold should be chosen high
enough to not be easily triggered by minor changes in node operating behavior,
but not so high that the security efficiency becomes unacceptably low.

> Choose TREE_EXPANSION_THRESHOLD = 0.5

#### TREE_EXPANSION_TRIGGER_WINDOW
Once all chains have confirmed $f_{global}$ above `TREE_EXPANSION_THRESHOLD`,
this is the number of consecutive _prime_ blocks that $f_{global}$ must remain
above the threshold to confirm the decision to expand the tree.

> Choose TREE_EXPANSION_TRIGGER_WINDOW = 144 prime blocks (apprx 24hrs at 10m
> prime block time)

#### TREE_EXPANSION_WAIT_COUNT
Once the network has confirmed the decision to expand the tree, this is the
number of _prime_ blocks to wait until the expansion is activated. This should
be chosen to give node operators some time to adjust their infrastructure, if
needed, to account for the upcoming network change.

> Choose TREE_EXPANSION_WAIT_COUNT = 1024 prime blocks (apprx 1 week at 10m
> prime block time)

#### TRANSACTION_WAIT_COUNT
Once a new chain has been added to the network, no chain may sent cross-chain
transactions to it, until it has at least `TRANSACTION_WAIT_COUNT` blocks built
upon the new chain's first coincident prime block.

> Choose TRANSACTION_WAIT_COUNT = 1024 prime blocks (apprx 1 week at 10m prime
> block time)
