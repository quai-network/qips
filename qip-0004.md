## Abstract

This QIP defines an address mapping to be used in a 9 shard hierarchy of the Quai protocol.

## Motivation

This defines the address mapping used in early testnets of the Quai protocol. Early testnets use a lighter 9-shard hierarchy. It has already been concluded that the mainnet should accommodate more than 9 shards, so this mapping is no longer recommended. We documented it here for wallet compatibility with early testnets.

## Specification

### Overview

The address space is divided into subsets according to address prefix. The account state for each subset of addresses will be maintained wholly by one and only one shard. Intra-shard transactions may only be processed by the blockchain which maintains that shard. Inter-shard transactions are possible, but the specification for those will be left to another QIP.

### Address Mapping

All addresses are mapped to exist in one of nine shards according to the MSB of the address. The Address groupings are given below:

| Name    | Region  | Zone    | Min Address                             | Max Address                             |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| cyprus1 | region-0| zone-0-0| 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000| 0x1DFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF|
| cyprus2 | region-0| zone-0-1| 0x1E00000000000000000000000000000000000000| 0x3AFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF|
