## Abstract

QIP-0007 defines Ristretto Curve25519 as a valid elliptic curve algorithm on Quai Network.

## Motivation
The integration of Ristretto will enhance the Quai Network’s security, speed, and capability. Further motivations for the selection of Ristretto are as follows:
- Cofactor Elimination: Ristretto is a prime-order group construction that enables the usage of curves like Curve25519 (which have small cofactors) safely in cryptographic protocols. This eliminates complexities and potential vulnerabilities associated with cofactor-related issues.
- Versatility and Privacy: The use of Ristretto enhances privacy and versatility, particularly in applications requiring complex cryptographic constructs, such as zero-knowledge proofs, where the prime-order group property is essential.
- Uniform Encoding and Decoding: Ristretto provides a uniform and non-malleable encoding and decoding mechanism. This feature is essential for systems that require consistent and secure methods to represent and process elliptic curve points, reducing the risk of subtle vulnerabilities in cryptographic applications.
- Consistent Group Operations: Ristretto ensures consistent group operations, free from edge cases associated with non-prime-order groups. This consistency is key to building more reliable and secure cryptographic protocols, as it standardizes behaviors across different implementations and use cases.


## Specification
### Definitions
Ristretto is a technique for constructing prime order elliptic curve groups with non-malleable encodings. It is used to build cryptographic primitives that are more secure and easier to implement correctly. The Ristretto Curve25519 is an instance of the Ristretto technique applied to the Curve25519.

### Key Derivation and Formats

#### Seed Format
- **Length:** 32 bytes.
- **Derivation:** Generated randomly or from a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.

#### SecretKey Format
- **Length:** 64 bytes (32-byte scalar, 32-byte nonce).
- **Derivation:** Directly from the Seed using a key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA512).

#### PublicKey Format
- **Length:** 32 bytes.
- **Derivation:** Derived from the SecretKey using elliptic curve point multiplication on the Ristretto curve.
- **Encoding:** 32-byte array, convertible to various formats such as hexadecimal.

#### Keypair Format
- **Composition:** SecretKey (64 bytes) and PublicKey (32 bytes).
- **Encoding:** Concatenated byte array of SecretKey and PublicKey.

### Public/Private Key Generation Process

1. **Entropy Acquisition:** 
   - Source: Obtain entropy from a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.
   - Validation: Ensure entropy matches BIP-39 word lengths (12, 15, 18, 21, 24 words).

2. **SecretKey Generation:**
   - Seed Generation: Convert entropy into a seed using a key derivation function.
   - SecretKey Creation: Derive the SecretKey from the seed. This key includes a scalar and nonce component.

3. **PublicKey Derivation:**
   - Process: Derive the public key from the SecretKey using the Ristretto curve's point multiplication.

4. **Keypair Assembly:**
   - Combine the SecretKey and the derived public key to form the complete keypair, used for cryptographic operations such as digital signing and verification.
