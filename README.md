People wishing to submit QIPs, first should propose their idea to the [Quai forum](https://forum.qu.ai) (do *not* assign a number - read [QIP 1](qip-0001.md) for the full process). After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving QIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a QIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Quai users.
